Diff Two Arrays 

Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  var newArr = [];
  var indexed;
  
  // Uses indexOf function on second array taking elements of first array as parameters by looping through it. If it does not find it, it pushes it into new array
  for (var i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
    
    indexed = arr2.indexOf(arr1[i]);
    if (indexed == -1) {
      newArr.push(arr1[i]);
    }      
  }
  
  // Uses indexOf function on first array taking elements of second array as parameters by looping through it. If not found, it is pushed into new array
  for (var j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++) {
    
    indexed = arr1.indexOf(arr2[j]);
    if (indexed == -1) {
      newArr.push(arr2[j]);
    }
  }
  
  // Same, same; but different.
  return newArr;
}

diffArray([1, 2, 4, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 5]);
