The fountain of knowledge

A dude came up on an oasis.

Sold the juice in 8 oz servings. Each cost is 3.50.

Only had 6 oz and 10 oz glass.

Is it possible to use the 6 oz glass and 10 oz glass
to produce exactly 8 oz in the 10 oz glass.

Given a 6 oz and 10 oz glass, is it possible to produce exactly 8 oz?
