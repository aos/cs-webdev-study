1. Alley wishes to ~find~ the Rama Nujan stone
2. Genie gives her 9 identical stones to which she has to find the real stone
3. One of the 9 stones weighs slightly more than the others
4. Alley inadvertently wishes for 2 balance scales, that can only be used once
5. Is it possible to find the real stone given only 2 1-shot scales?

-- Solution:
Divide the 9 stones into groups of 3. Take 2 groups (chosen randomly) and
weigh them against each other. Two scenarios are likely to happen:
1. One group of stones weighs more than the other
  - In this case, the group that weighs more will contain the Rama Nujan.
  - Take this group of stones, pick two stones from the group, and
    weigh them against each other.
      - If the two stones weigh the same, the remaining stone is the Rama Nujan.
      - If one stone is heavier, that stone is the Rama Nujan.

2. Both groups weigh the same
  - In this case, take the group that was not weighed and pick two stones
    from the group, and weigh them against each other.
      - If the two stones weigh the same, remaining stone is Rama Nujan.
      - If one stone is heavier, that stone is the Rama Nujan.
