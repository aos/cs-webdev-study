# Towers of Hanoi

Three stacks, one full of discs.
- Only one disc can be moved at a time
- Only move a smaller disc on top of a bigger disc

Tips:
- Keep track of state
- Break down the problem into a single step first
- Notice that the placement of the first disk determines where
the future stack will be located
  - If even: opposite location of first disc
  - If odd: same location as first disc
