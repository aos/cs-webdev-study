How many hands did Stacy shake?

## Simpler Shaky Story

Reduce the problem to its simplest. What about if we had only one other couple
attend the party?

Total people: 4, can't shake hands with self or spouse (-2):
Max hands shook: 2

Person  Hands shook
1       0
2       1
3       2

How many hands did Stacy shake?
- If Stacy shook 0 hands, person 2 shook 1 hand (the only person's hand they 
  can shake would be Sam's), then person 3 can't shake 2 hands 
  (since the only person they can shake hands with is Sam). 

- If Stacy shook 1 hand, person 1 shook 0 hands, 
  person 3 CAN shake 2 hands (Sam's and Stacy's).

- If Stacy shook 2 hands, this is not possible if person 1 shook 0 hands 
  since the only person she can shake hands with now is person 3.

--> The answer to the simpler problem is Stacy shook 1 hand.

### A Three-Couple Shaky Story
