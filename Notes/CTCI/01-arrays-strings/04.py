# 04. Palindrome Permutation
#
# Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation
# of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same
# forwards and backwards. The palindrome does not need to be limited
# to dictionary words.
#
# Example
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
