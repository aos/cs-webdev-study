/** 3.5 -- Sort Stack
 *
 * Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top.
 * You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements
 * into any other data strcuture (such as an array). The stack supports the
 * following operations: 'push', 'pop', 'peek', 'isEmpty'.
