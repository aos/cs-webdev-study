/** 2.5 - Sum Lists
 *
 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where 
 * each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored 
 * in ~reverse~ order, such that the 1's digit is the head
 * of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and
 * returns the sum as a linked list.
 *
 * Example: 
 * Input (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). 617 + 295
 * Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. 912
 *
 * Suppose digits are stored in forward order?
 * Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). 617 + 295
 * Output: 9 -> 1 -> 2. 912
